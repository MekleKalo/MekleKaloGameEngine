# MekleKalo Game Engine
Personal project for a game engine and a game.

This project should finish sometime around March 2025, you could help until then or wait once it's done and try using it.
It is unlikely that I continue developing this after that.
Will not quarantee it works on anything other than win10 but it probably will.
Written in Python using Thonny.


Current plans are mostly vague but I hope to be able to make it have the following:

1. Random generation
2. Simple item and ability system
3. Procedurally animated entities
4. Particle system
5. Shaders

Game itself will be pretty barebones. Main focus is the engine itself.
